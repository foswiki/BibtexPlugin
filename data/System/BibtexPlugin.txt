%CITE{BahrSimpson02}%
</verbatim>
you get (simulated) <img src="%ATTACHURL%/bibtex-cite-ex.png" alt="bibtex select example"> (if installed) %CITE{BahrSimpson02}%

The text within the citation is dictated by the results of the =%<nop>BIBTEXREF%= declaration in the topic (see below).

*Note:* The =%<nop>CITE%= macro is also defined by the Foswiki:Extensions.BibliographyPlugin. If both plugins are installed, one must use the alternate declaration, =%<nop>BIBCITE{...}%=, to access the !BibtexPlugin functionality.

---++ Syntax
	* =%<nop>BIBTEX{&lt;attributes&gt;}%= - render a set of bibtex files attached to some topic 
	* =%<nop>STARTBIBTEX{&lt;attributes&gt;}% ... %<nop>STOPBIBTEX%= - render an inline-bibtex database
	* =%<nop>CITE{key}%= (or =%<nop>BIBCITE{key}%=) - generate an hyperlink to a bibtex entry 
	* =%<nop>BIBTEXREF{key, topic}%= - generate a list of references based on the declared =CITE= keys

---++ Attributes
All attributes for =%<nop>BIBTEX%= and =%<nop>STARTBIBTEX%= are optional. The attributes =topic= and =bibfile=
are not valid in the =%<nop>STARBIBTEX%= tag as the bibtex database is given inline and not as an attachment.
=%<nop>CITE%= has one obligatory attribute, that is =key= refering to the bibtex entry that is to be
cited. =topic= is optional here and defaults to the recently used bibtex database location in a =%<nop>BIBTEX%= tag on the same topic (see [[#Tips][Tips]]).

| *option* | *value*	  | *description* |
| topic | =(webName.)topicName= | a valid topic where bibtex files are attached. |
| file  | =bibfile=	| a regular expression specifying one or more bibtex files attached to \
								=webName.topicName=, must have the extension =.bib= \
								if no =bibfile= is specified all bibfiles attached are used |
| select | =query=	 | see chapter [[#QueryAnchor][The Query Language]] for an explamation | 
| sort  | =sorting=	| how to sort the bibentries; possible values are =year= (default), =author=  and =none= |
| bibstyle | =bibstyle=		| can be one of the installed <nop>BibTeX styles installed on the servers system \
								 plus the special styles =bibtool= and =raw=: <ul> \
  <li> =bibtool= : keys are generated in the style defined in the =bibtoolrcs= file (default)</li> \
  <li> =raw= : output is displayed in as raw bibtex (inside a &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt; environment. </li></ul> |
| rev	| =on=, =off= | reverse or normal sorting (default =on= ) |
| mix	| =on=, =off=	| switch on/off formatting of html and raw bibtex entries mixed (default =off=) |
| errors | =on=, =off=  | display standard errors generated by the rendering pipeline tools \
								 (e.g. warnings about double entries) in multiple bibfiles |
| abstract | =on=, =off= | switch on/off rendering the abstract-field if present in the entries (default =off=) |
| keywords | =on=, =off= | switch on/off rendering the keywords-field if present in the entries (default =off=) | 
| form | =on=, =off=, =only=, =(formWeb.)formTopic= | delcare which query form to use, if any: <ul> \
  <li> =on=: use the default query form at BibtexSearchTemplate </li> \
  <li> =off=: (default) don't display a query form </li> \
  <li> =formWeb.formTopic=: declare a query form to be displayed </li> \
  <li> =only=: don't start to display the complete unfiltered database, but only show the query form</li> \
  </ul> |

---++ Citations and Automated Reference Lists
As of release v1.3, !BibtexPlugin has functionality similar to the Foswiki:Extensions.BibliographyPlugin.  Specifically, if a topic has =%<nop>CITE{key}%= declarations through out, the use of =%<nop>BIBTEXREF{...}%= will generate a list of references based on the citations declared.  The output of the reference list is dictated by <nop>BibTeX.  Thus, the HTML output can use all of the flexibility of bibtex, including custom bibtex style templates and string macros.

The citation keys _must refer to the output key produced by this plugin_, which may differ from the entries in the associated .bib files according to the bibtool resource file in use.  Simply use the output key produced by [[#SearchTemplates][<nop>BibtexPlugin search template]] query results.

Again, if both the Foswiki:Extensions.BibliographyPlugin and Foswiki:BibtexPlugin are installed, one must use =%<nop>BIBCITE{...}%= inplace of =%<nop>CITE%= for the !BibtexPlugin functionality to work.

#QueryAnchor
---++ The Query Language
The information here is extracted from the bibtex2html manual (section 3.2: Filter conditions) and might be incomplete or outdated. Please
see [[http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/doc][here]] for more information. Anyhow here's a version
matching the naming conventions that we use here (filter conndition = =query=).

A query is a boolean expression that is evaluated against a <nop>BibTeX entry to decide whether this entry should be selected. A query is either: 
	* a comparison between two expressions, written as __e1 op e2__ 
	* a matching of a field name with respect to a regular expression, written as __field : regexp__
	* a conjunction of two conditions, written as __c1 and c2__
	* a disjunction of two conditions, written as __c1 or c2__
	* a negation of a condition, written as __not c__ (or __! c__)
	* a test of existence of a field, written as __exists f__ (or __? f__) where f is a field name

where an expression is either: 
	* a __field__ name
	* a __string__ constant between single quotes
	* an __integer__ constant
	* the special ident __$key__ which corresponds to the key of an entry. 
	* the special ident __$type__ which corresponds to the type of an entry (ARTICLE, INPROCEEDINGS, etc.).
	  notice that an entry type is always written in uppercase letters. 
	* comparison operators are the usual ones: <b><tt> =, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= and &lt;&gt; </tt></b>

The field names are any sequences of lowercase or uppercase letters (but no distinction is made between lowercase and uppercase letters).
 
Regular expressions must be put between single or double quotes, and must follow the GNU syntax of regular expressions,
as for example in GNU Emacs. Any character other than $^.*+?[] matches itself, see the following table 
for the meaning of the special characters:
| . | matches any character except newline |
| [..] | character set; ranges are denoted with -, as in [a-z]; an initial ^, as in [^0-9], complements the set |
| ^ | matches the beginning of the string matched |
| $ | matches the end of the string matched |
| \b | matches word boundaries |
| \ | quotes special characters |
| regexp* | matches regexp zero, one or several times |
| regexp+ | matches regexp one or several times |
| regexp? | matches regexp once or not at all |
| regexp1 \&Iota; regexp2 | alternative between two regular expressions, this operator has low priority against *, + and ? |
| \( regexp \) | grouping regular expression |

#CustomizingAnchor
---++ Customizing Look &amp; Feel
The BibtexPlugin is customizable in several ways:
	* manipulate the cascading style sheets sitewide or derived on one topic
	* implementing an different BibtexSearchTemplate used with the =form= attribute of the =%<nop>BIBTEX%= command
	* rewriting the bibtool resourcefile shipped with the BibtexPlugin

---+++ Cascading Stylesheets
Here's the list of used styles:
| *class* | *description* |
| bibtex | division (&lt;div...&gt;) surrounding the complete bibtex. \
			  The entries are rendered using a definition list: <br /> \
			 &lt;dl&gt; <br /> \
			 ... <br /> \
			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dt&gt; =keyA= &lt;/dt&gt; <br /> \
			 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dd&gt; =entry= &lt;/dd&gt; <br /> \
			 ... <br /> \
			 &lt;/dl&gt; |
| bibabstract | division surrounding the abstract |
| bibcomment | division surrounding the comment |
| bibkeywords | division surrounding the keywords |
| bibsearch | class of the table in the BibtexSearchTemplate |
| biboptions | class of the options table in the BibtexSearchTemplate |
See [[#Tips][Tips]] for an example on how to modify the look easily.

#SearchTemplates
---+++ !BibtexPlugin search templates
The !BibteXPlugin search templates provide an interactive query interface to
the bibtex files present on a wiki.  As an example of their use, one can declare
<verbatim>
%BIBTEX{form="only"}%
</verbatim>
in a topic to which .bib files are attached.  The resulting rendered form
(defined by DEFAULTSEARCHTEMPLATE above) can then be used to query the .bib
files.

	* Available search templates
		* System.BibtexSearchTemplate - verbose .bib file query form
		* System.BibtexSimpleSearchTemplate - !BibTeX key query form
		* System.BibtexSelectTemplate - query .bib files using bib2bib 'select' syntax

---+++ Bibtool Resource Files
Actually this is an art for itself. The author has taken care to give you a quite reasonable
resource file for bibtool. This contains an own (default) style of citation keys. You might
have a look at the bibtool manual page and dig into the =bibtoolrcs= file yourself.

---++ Examples
	* =%<nop>BIBTEX%= <br />
	  Render all bibtex entries in the bibtex files attached to the =DEFAULTWEB.DEFAULTTOPIC= in the =DEFAULTSTYLE= with the =DEFAULTSORT=.

	* =%<nop>BIBTEX{web="Sandbox" topic="BibTest" file="cite.bib" select="author : 'Einstein'"}%= <br />
	  Use cite.bib which is attached in <nop>Sandbox under the topic <nop>BibTest as the <nop>BibTeX file.
	  Embeds all of the references from the <nop>BibTeX file which have Einstein in the author field

	* =%<nop>BIBTEX{file="cite.bib" select="author : 'Einstein|Fermi' and year=2003"}%=
		* Use cite.bib which is attached to the =DEFAULTWEB= under the topic =DEFAULTTOPIC=
		  as the <nop>BibTeX file
		* Embeds all of the references from the <nop>BibTeX file which have Einstein or Fermi in the author field and
		  2003 in the year field
		* Format the embedded text as =DEFAULTSTYLE=

	* Selecting entries of a given year
		* select only entries that appeared in 1999 : <b><tt>select="year=1999"</tt></b>
		* select references appearing after and/or before a given year, e.g. references after 1997: <br />
		 <b><tt>select="year>1997"</tt></b>
		* references between 1990 and 1995: <br />
		 <b><tt>select="year&gt;=1990 and year&lt;=1995"</tt></b>

	* Selecting references of a given author
		* select only entries whose (co)author is Donald Knuth: <br />
		  <b><tt>select="author : 'Knuth'"</tt></b>
		* if you would like to have only the references whose author is Knuth only, you may try: <br />
		  <b><tt>select="author : '^\(Donald \(E. \)?Knuth\|Knuth, Donald \(E.\)?\)$'"</tt></b>
		* or equivalently but missing the possible E.: <br />
		  <b><tt>select="author = 'Donald Knuth or author = 'Knuth, Donald'"</tt></b>

	* Other examples
		* extract the references that appeared since 1995 and have lambda-calculus in their title, with anything between
		  "lambda" and "calculus": <br />
		  <b><tt>select="year >= 1995 and title : 'lambda.*calculus'"</tt></b>
		* select entries for Wolfgang Menzel since year 2000: <br />
		  <b><tt>select="author : 'Wolfgang Menzel' or author = 'Menzel, Wolfgang' and year>=2000"</tt></b>

---++ Tips
	* Setting the current bibtex database for citations:<br />
	  Having a set of citations =%<nop>CITE{keyA}%= ... =%<nop>CITE{keyZ}%=
	  refering to the same database is achievable in several ways:
		* by attaching _all_ your bibtex files at a common place and set the =DEFAULTTOPIC= in the [[#Global_Settings][Global Settings]] section to that topic, or
		* by declaring the current database in the first =%<nop>CITE%= tag: =%<nop>CITE{"keyA" topic="Main.BibtexDatabase"}%=, or
		* by setting the current database with =%<nop>BIBTEX{topic="BibtexDatabase" display="off"}%=, or
		* by specifying the bibtex database in every =%<nop>CITE%= tag (not seriously)
	* Merging bibtex databases from different sources: <br />
	  If there are lots of databases all over your Foswiki site, you might want to merge them or extend them
	  with some extra entries you don't want in the main database. Example: the main database contains all
	  publications of your division but not the crossrefering presentation slides. You might want to keep 
	  them separate on your home-topic. You do that by _nesting_ one or several =%<nop>BIBTEX{...bibstyle="raw"...}%= 
	  commands inside a =%<nop>STARBIBTEX% ... %<nop>STOPBIBTEX%= section.
<verbatim>
	%STARTBIBTEX%
	%BIBTEX{select="author:'YourName'" bibstyle="raw"}%
	@Misc{YourName02Slides,
		crossref = {YourName02},
		note = {slides of oral presentation},
	}
	%STOPBIBTEX%
</verbatim>
	* Manipulating the Cascading Style Sheet: <br />
	  You possibly don't like the default stylesheet for bibtexing installed on your Foswiki site. Or you just
	  want to render a bibtex database differently on a single topic. Then add a stylesheet section in the topic:
	  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt;. Section [[#CustomizingAnchor][Customizing Look &amp; Feel]]
	  lists the styles used.
	  Here's a small example of how to get a different look easily. Just put it on some topic and see:
<verbatim>
<style type="text/css">
	.bibtex {
		background:transparent;
		border:0px;
	}
	.bibtex dd {
		margin-left:30px;
		margin-right:30px;
	}
</style>
</verbatim>


---++ Global Settings
	* Default topic name for <nop>BibTeX files:
		* Set DEFAULTTOPIC = System.BibtexPlugin

	* Default search template
		* Set DEFAULTSEARCHTEMPLATE = System.BibtexSearchTemplate

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions
%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

Test if the installation was successful: See if above examples work

If access control is managed at the web-server level, be sure to add
=bibsearch= to the authorization list. E.g., for Apache, add the following
lines to the =.htaccess= or Apache =conf= file: 
<verbatim>
<Files "bibsearch">
       require valid-user
</Files>
</verbatim>
